            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>My name is Aman and I currently school at the University of Ilorin. I am a passionate learner interested
                in web development. I enjoy creating clean, functional designs and
                learning new technologies that improve how people interact with the web.</p>

        <section data-test-id="test-about-goals">
            <h2>Goals in this Program</h2>
            <p>My main goal is to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and eventually become confident in
                using Javascript frameworks such as React, Angular to build complete web applications.</p>

        <section data-test-id="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>Sometimes I get stuck on how to proprly structure layouts using CSS but I am learning to slow
                down,take breaks and trust the process.</p>

        <section data-test-id="test-about-future-note">
            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>Keep pushing even when things get tough. Every bug fixed and every new concept understood brings you
                closer to being the developer you want to become.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-test-id="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>I believe that what really matters in becoming a successsful developer is consistency rather than speed.
                Keep building, keep learning, and keep believing in your ability to
                grow.</p>
